Multipart update via method override (file upload):

```bash
# Note: This uses the X-HTTP-Method: PUT header to override the POST method.
# HTML forms and multipart/form-data only support GET/POST, so we use POST
# with the X-HTTP-Method header to indicate PUT semantics.
# The API's method-override middleware rewrites this to PUT before routing.
# See DOCUMENTATION.json for detailed explanation.

## 8. Role-based Scenario Examples

## 8.1 Plain user attempts worker creation (expected 403)

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$API_BASE_URL/workers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Unauthorized Worker","categoryId":"<category-id>"}'
```

Expected error envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Forbidden",
  "code": 403
}
```

## 8.2 Missing JWT (expected 401)

```bash
curl -i "$API_BASE_URL/auth/me"
```

Expected:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "code": 401
}
```

## 9. Common Error Response Examples

## 9.1 Validation error (400)

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$API_BASE_URL/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"invalid","password":"short"}'
```

## 9.2 Resource not found (404)

```bash
curl -i "$API_BASE_URL/workers/non-existent-id"
```

Common envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Worker not found",
  "code": 404
}
```

## 9.3 Internal error (500)

All unexpected server failures follow this envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Internal server error",
  "code": 500
}
```

## 10. Rate Limiting Behavior

The project includes an auth rate-limiter configuration in `src/config/rateLimiter.ts` with defaults:

- window: 15 minutes (`900000` ms)
- max: 10 requests per IP
- response code: `429`

Example 429 envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
  "code": 429
}
```

Load test example (for auth endpoints where limiter is enabled):

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    -X POST "$API_BASE_URL/auth/login" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"ada@example.com","password":"wrong-password"}'
done
```

Inspect standard rate-limit headers:

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$API_BASE_URL/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ada@example.com","password":"wrong-password"}'
```
